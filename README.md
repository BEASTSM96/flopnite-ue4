## What is Flopnite [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/BEASTSM96/flopnite/blob/v2/LICENSE)
Relatively new to game development, my friends and I wanted to challenge ourselves by recreating the popular triple A game *Fortnite* in a limited time frame while having fun doing so. We also documented the process and posted the documentaries to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCyIgPcXKLQ). This recreation was made using Unreal Engine 4 and Amazon GameLift.

## Who was involved in Weekly
I am proud to say that this was truly a community effort. Although I was the main programmer, we had many people who contribute by providing art assets and game code:
* [Ryan Thomas](https://github.com/rthomas24)
* [Mike Decaprio](https://www.instagram.com/mikedecaprio1/)

Also, a big thanks has to be given to all the people who answer questions in the Unreal Slackers Discord, all the people who answer questions on the Unreal Q&A forums, all the youtubers who post amazing Unreal tutorials, all the people who answer questions on the AWS Game Tech forums, and all the people in our Discord who came out to test the game.

## For those who want to test
We are currently looking for testers for a huge game session! If you're interested, then join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2xbR5qT).
